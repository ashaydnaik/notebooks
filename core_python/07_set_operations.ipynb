    "Python provides a variety of operations applicable to sets (both plain and frozen). \n",
    "\n",
    "Since sets are containers, the built-in ``len`` function can take a set as its single argument and return the number of items in the set. \n",
    "\n",
    "A set is iterable, so you can pass it to any function or method that takes an iterable argument. In this case, iteration yields the items of the set in some arbitrary order. For example, for any set ``S``, ``min(S)`` returns the smallest item in ``S``, since ``min`` with a single argument iterates on that argument (the order does not matter, because the implied comparisons are transitive).\n",
    "\n",
    "# set membership\n",
    "\n",
    "The ``k in S`` operator checks whether object ``k`` is one of the items of set ``S``. It returns ``True`` when it is, ``False`` when it isn’t. ``k not in S`` is like ``not (k in S)``.\n",
    "\n",
    "# set methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Set objects provide several methods. Nonmutating methods return a result without altering the object to which they apply, and can also be called on instances of ``frozenset``; mutating methods may alter the object to which they apply, and can be called only on instances of ``set``. \n",
    "\n",
    "* ``S`` denotes any set object\n",
    "* ``S1`` any iterable with hashable items (often but not necessarily a ``set`` or ``frozenset``) \n",
    "* ``x`` any hashable object\n",

    "| Method | Description |\n",
    "|:-------|:------------|\n",
    "| ``S.copy()``| Returns a shallow copy of ``S``(a copy whose items are the same objects as ``S``’s, not copies thereof), like ``set(S)`` |\n",
    "|``S.difference(S1)`` | Returns the set of all items of ``S`` that aren’t in ``S1`` |\n",
    "| ``S.intersection(S1)`` | Returns the set of all items of ``S`` that are also in ``S1`` |\n",
    "| ``S.issubset(S1)``| Returns True when all items of ``S`` are also in ``S1``; otherwise, returns False |\n",
    "| ``S.issuperset(S1)`` | Returns True when all items of ``S1`` are also in ``S``; otherwise, returns False (like ``S1.issubset(S)``) |\n",
    "| ``S.symmetric_difference(S1)`` | Returns the set of all items that are in either ``S`` or ``S1``, but not both|\n",

    "| ``S.discard(x)`` | Removes x as an item of S; no effect when x was not an item of S | \n",
    "| ``S.pop()`` | Removes and returns an arbitrary item of S | \n",

    "\n",
    "All mutating methods of set objects, except ``pop``, return ``None``.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ``pop`` method can be used for destructive iteration on a set, consuming little extra memory. The memory savings make ``pop`` usable for a loop on a huge set, when what you want is to “consume” the set in the course of the loop. A potential advantage of a destructive loop such as\n",
    "\n",
    "``while S:\n",
    "    item = S.pop()\n",
    "    ...handle item...``\n",
    "\n",
    "in comparison to a nondestructive loop such as\n",
    "\n",
    "``for item in S: \n",
    "    ...handle item...``\n",
    "\n",
    "is that, in the body of the destructive loop, you’re allowed to modify S (adding and/or removing items), which is not allowed in the nondestructive loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sets also have mutating methods:\n",
    "* ``difference_update`` \n",
    "* ``intersection_update``\n",
    "* ``symmetric_difference_update``\n",
    "* ``update`` (corresponding to non-mutating method union)\n",
    "\n",
    "Each such mutating method performs the same operation as the corresponding nonmutating method, but it performs the operation in place, altering the set on which you call it, and returns ``None``. \n",
    "\n",
    "The four corresponding non-mutating methods are also accessible with operator syntax: where ``S2`` is a ``set`` or ``frozenset``, respectively, ``S-S2``, ``S&S2``, ``S^S2``, and ``S|S2``; the mutating methods are accessible with augmented assignment syntax: respectively, ``S-=S2``, ``S&=S2``, ``S^=S2``, and ``S|=S2``. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that, when you use operator or augmented assignment syntax, both operands must be sets or frozensets; however, when you call named methods, argument ``S1`` can be any iterable with hashable items, and it works just as if the argument you passed was ``set(S1)``.\n"
