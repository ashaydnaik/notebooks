    "A Python program is a sequence of logical lines, each made up of one or more physical lines. Each physical line may end with a comment. A hash sign # that is not inside a string literal starts a comment. All characters after the #, up to but excluding the line end, are the comment: Python ignores them. A line containing only whitespace, possibly with a comment, is a blank line: Python ignores it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the end of a physical line marks the end of most statements. Unlike in other languages, you don’t normally terminate Python statements with a delimiter, such as a semicolon. When a statement is too long to fit on a physical line, you can join two adjacent physical lines into a logical line by ensuring that the first physical line has no comment and ends with a backslash. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, Python also automatically joins adjacent physical lines into one logical line if an open parenthesis, bracket, or brace has not yet been closed: take advantage of this mechanism to produce more readable code than you’d get with backslashes at line ends. \n",
    "\n",
    "Triple-quoted string literals can also span physical lines. Physical lines after the first one in a logical line are known as continuation lines. Indentation issues apply to the first physical line of each logical line, not to continuation lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python uses indentation to express the block structure of a program. Unlike other languages, Python does not use braces, or other begin/end delimiters, around blocks of statements; indentation is the only way to denote blocks. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each logical line in a Python program is indented by the whitespace on its left. A block is a contiguous sequence of logical lines, all indented by the same amount; a logical line with less indentation ends the block. All statements in a block must have the same indentation, as must all clauses in a compound statement. The first statement in a source file must have no indentation (i.e., must not begin with any whitespace).\n",
    "\n",
    "Standard Python style is to use four spaces (never tabs) per indentation level. Don’t mix spaces and tabs for indentation, since different tools (e.g., editors, email systems, printers) treat tabs differently. We recommend you configure your favorite editor to expand tabs to four spaces, so that all Python source code you write contains just spaces, not tabs. "
