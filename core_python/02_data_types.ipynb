    "A built-in string object (bytes or Unicode) is a sequence of characters used to store and represent text-based information (byte strings, also known as byte objects, store and represent arbitrary sequences of binary bytes). Strings in Python are immutable: when you perform an operation on strings, you always produce a new string object, rather than mutating an existing string. String objects provide many methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "A string literal can be quoted or triple-quoted. A quoted string is a sequence of 0+ characters within matching quotes, single (') or double (\"). The two different kinds of quotes function identically; having both lets you include one kind of quote inside of a string specified with the other kind, with no need to escape quote characters with the backslash character (\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "Other things equal, using single quotes to denote string literals is better Python style. To have a string literal span multiple physical lines, you can use a \\ as the last character of a line to indicate that the next line is a continuation.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make the string contain multiple lines, use triple-quoted string. The only character that cannot be part of a triple-quoted string is an unescaped backslash, while a quoted string cannot contain unescaped backslashes, nor line ends, nor the quote character that encloses it.\n",
    "\n",
    "A variant of a string literal is a raw string. The syntax is the same as for quoted or triple-quoted string literals, except that an r or R immediately precedes the leading quote. In raw strings, escape sequences are literally copied into the string, including backslashes and newline characters. Raw string syntax is handy for strings that include many backslashes, especially regular expression patterns. A raw string cannot end with an odd number of backslashes: the last one would be taken as escaping the terminating quote. Raw strings are not a different type from ordinary strings; they are just an alternative syntax for literals of the usual two string types, byte strings and Unicode.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Unicode string literals you can use \\u followed by four hex digits, and \\U followed by eight hex digits, to denote Unicode characters, and can also include escape sequences. Unicode literals can also include the escape sequence \\N{name}, where name is a standard Unicode name, as listed at http://www.unicode.org/charts/. For example, \\N{Copyright Sign} indicates a Uni‐ code copyright sign character (©).\n",
    "\n",
    "**New in 3.6** formatted string literals let you inject formatted expressions into your strings, which are therefore no longer constants but subject to evaluation at execution time. From a syntactic point of view, they can be regarded just as another kind of string literal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple string literals of any kind — quoted, triple-quoted, raw, bytes, formatted, Unicode —can be adjacent, with optional whitespace in between. The compiler concatenates such adjacent string literals into a single string object. Writing a long string literal in this way lets you present it readably across multiple physical lines and gives you an opportunity to insert comments about parts of the string. "
