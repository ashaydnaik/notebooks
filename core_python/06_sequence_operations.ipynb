    "\n",
    "Sequences are ordered containers with items that are accessible by indexing and slicing. \n",
    "* The built-in ``len`` function takes any container as an argument and returns the number of items in the container. \n",
    "* The built-in ``min`` and ``max`` functions take one argument, a nonempty iterable whose items are comparable, and return the smallest and largest items, respectively. You can also call ``min`` and ``max`` with multiple arguments, in which case they return the smallest and largest arguments, respectively. \n",
    "* The built-in ``sum`` function takes one argument, an iterable whose items are numbers, and returns the sum of the numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sequence conversions\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no implicit conversion between different sequence types except that Python, in v2 only, converts byte strings to Unicode strings if needed. \n",
    "* You can call the built-ins ``tuple`` and ``list`` with a single argument (any iterable) to get a new instance of the type you’re calling, with the same items, in the same order, as in the argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Concatenation and repetition\n",
    "\n",
    "* You can concatenate sequences of the same type with the ``+`` operator. \n",
    "* You can multiply a sequence ``S`` by an integer ``n`` with the ``*`` operator. ``S*n`` or ``n*S`` is the concatenation of ``n`` copies of ``S``. When ``n<=0``, ``S*n`` is an empty sequence of the same type as ``S``.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Membership testing\n",
    "\n",
    "* The ``x in S`` operator tests to check whether object ``x`` equals any item in the sequence (or other kind of container or iterable) ``S``. It returns ``True`` when it does and ``False`` when it doesn’t. \n",
    "* The ``x not in S`` operator is equivalent to ``not (x in S)``. \n",
    "* For dictionaries, ``x in S`` tests for the presence of ``x`` as a ``key``. \n",
    "* In the specific case of strings, though, ``x in S`` is more widely applicable; in this case, ``x in S`` tests whether ``x`` equals any substring of ``S``, not just any single character.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Indexing a sequence\n",
    "\n",
    "To denote the ``nth`` item of a sequence ``S``, use an indexing: ``S[n]``. \n",
    "Indexing is zero-based (``S``’s first item is ``S[0]``). \n",
    "If ``S`` has ``L`` items, the index ``n`` may be ``0, 1...`` up to and including ``L-1``, but no larger. ``n`` may also be ``-1, -2...``down to and including ``-L``, but no smaller. \n",
    "A negative ``n`` (e.g., -1) denotes the same item in ``S`` as ``L+n`` (e.g., ``L + -1``) does. In other words, ``S[-1]``, like ``S[L-1]``, is the last element of ``S``, ``S[-2]`` is the next-to-last one, and so on. For example:"
